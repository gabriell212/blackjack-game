Blackjack (LogicSphere Studio)

Why did I make it?

This is a simple TicTacToe game with UI I've made in C# using .NET Framework (WinForms App). I've created this for a project in college where we were a team and had to create a website for a fictional company and attach some "personal projects" that the company would have. The team was structured in 4 people where 2 were doing the website (in WordPress), 1 was managing social media and me who had to do the projects I was talking about.

What have you learned?

I've learned using a basic class and setting modifiers according to my needings (both public and private, highlighted especially in the class). Also, I've learned to create objects and place them on the Form without using the ToolBox (I have created them manually). I have learned how to use a class properly. In this case I have a class which would store a card. I know how to access and set what I need. In addition, now I have a better knowledge on how to create functions in a more general way (because initially, there were way more functions than you'd see on the current code).

What tech did you use?

I've used just Visual Studio Code 2022 to code the entire app in C# .NET Framework, WinForms App.

What went well?

I can say for sure that creating, using and manipulating the objects was the thing that went the best for me. The process and the idea to create a class of each card rather than going with Lists or Arrays was an idea that made my job easier. First time I've used a class and gave me morale boost for learning more advanced things about them. I didn't fear getting some help from friends and criticism from them. I think that led to a lot of improvements.

What went poorly?

I'd say memory management. I think I have used too many lists, variables and maybe I could've done this better. Also, I've had some troubles when creating the functions, because there were too many and I just lost myself in them. Looking further into improving this. Frustration. I know it's definetly not a hard thing I've created. However during the process I went through a lot of frustration and affected my concentration. This is a priority in the "to-not-do list".
